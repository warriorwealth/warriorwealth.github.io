    <div class="entry-content"><p>My mission with <a href="http://blog.sixpackwarriors.com/" title="Six Pack Warriors">Six Pack Warriors</a> has always been to create a community of warriors who will relentlessly push to conquer their dream goals in terms of health and physique. My vision has always been to create a world of believers who choose to invest in their health above all, something that everything else in life depends on.</p>

<p>However, throughout the past 7 years of my body transformation journey, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that our investment in our health and physique is only that stepping stone, the platform, the foundation, upon which all of our other goals in life are built upon - I absolutely believe that our foundation is simply the first step to getting what we want out of life.</p>

<p>Because transforming our bodies is just the first step in our journey as a warrior, I&rsquo;ve often found myself asking, &ldquo;What exactly, then, is that next step?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And after thinking long and hard about that question over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that the next most important aspect of our lives is what most undoubtedly base many of their decisions upon: <strong>wealth</strong>.</p>

<p>I cannot deny the importance of wealth. I&rsquo;ve seen firsthand how a lack of wealth limits our decisions and creates frustration among ourselves and our loved ones. I&rsquo;ve also seen the consequences of a lack of proper financial education. Without knowing <em>how</em> to grow our wealth, we can&rsquo;t live the life that we desire in confidence. Without knowing <em>how</em> to grow our net worth, we often find ourselves in a position where we worry about living paycheck to paycheck, where we are limited to the numerous choices that life has to offer.</p>

<p>Which poses the question: how exactly can we harness the knowledge and skills obtained through the initial stepping stones built from our body transformation journey, and apply those concepts to transforming our wealth?</p>

<p>Luckily for you, I have already taken a step in that direction by spending the past few years investing, specifically in the stock markets. Throughout this period, I have picked up a tremendous amount of knowledge around capital preservation and growth. More importantly, I&rsquo;ve recently learned how to consistently extract money out of the markets over time to grow my net worth.</p>

<p>So it is with my pleasure to share with you <em>Warrior Wealth</em> - a blog dedicated to helping you do exactly this: <strong>grow your net worth.</strong></p>

<p>In this blog, I&rsquo;m going to share with you everything that I&rsquo;ve learned over the years regarding the stock markets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to share with you educational articles around stocks, options, and foreign exchange.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also going to share with you my current investment portfolio with full transparency. You will be able to see all of my ongoing trades, including profits and losses. Feel free to follow along with my holdings as we take advantage of the opportunities that the markets have to offer.</p>

<p>I believe that there is no better time than now to start investing in our wealth. So if you would like to join myself and other warriors in this journey of expanding our wealth, alongside our health, then you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. Warrior Wealth will help you obtain the necessary financial education you need to be able to passively preserve and grow your capital over time. So let us take charge of our lives, conquer this next stepping stone, and ultimately build a legacy of health and wealth.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Your warrior companion,<br/>
Ken Yu</p>
