    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello traders,</p>

<p>As $BLUE breaks out to new highs, one may consider if it&rsquo;s too late to go long. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the daily chart of $BLUE below.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170928/blue_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170928/blue_daily.png" alt="BLUE Daily - 2017-09-28" /></a></p>

<p>$BLUE has consistently held the 200MA and 100MA since last year, and we&rsquo;re now seeing the stock trend above the 20MA. This is a signal of a strong upwards trend. While that can change at any moment, current signals point to getting long.</p>

<p>For trend traders, what matters isn&rsquo;t about how much money to make. <strong>Rather, what matters is being in the trend with the right position size, according to your personal risk tolerance, in order to stay in the trend.</strong></p>

<p>Conservative traders would use the 200MA as a reference point when considering where to place their stop as part of the trend trade, while more aggressive traders would use the 20MA, as placing a closer stop allows them to have a bigger position size (albeit getting stopped out earlier should the stock fall down, but maintain trend above the 200MA). Again, this choice is up to the investor, and is one we highly recommend each individual consider before taking on a position in order to be able to hold for the duration of the trend.</p>

<p>Always consider the amount of risk you&rsquo;re willing to take in the position, before you think about potential profits. As long as you manage risk properly, you&rsquo;ll be able to stay with the trend.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: we are currently long $BLUE, with a stop below the 200MA at $85.51 as of the time of writing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders,</p>

<p>One of the things that we love most are chart patterns that exhibit 200MA breaches. One of the following is of course, $FIT, which has picked up a lot of chatter today.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170927/fit_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170927/fit_daily.png" alt="FIT Daily - 2017-09-27" /></a></p>

<p>$FIT has breached the 200MA early in September. Breaches like this usually (but not always) signal a reversal and the start of a new trend higher. Without a doubt, $FIT is a long in our books. With proper stop loss placement just below the 200MA at 5.71, we will be looking to ride this stock until it closes below the 200MA. As always, should you get long, size your position according to your personal risk tolerance.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: we are currently long $FIT as of time of writing.</p>

    <link href="http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/27/vcel-trending-up/"/>

    <id>http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/27/vcel-trending-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders,</p>

<p>One hot stock today is $VCEL. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the chart.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170927/vcel_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170927/vcel_daily.png" alt="VCEL Daily - 2017-09-27" /></a></p>

<p>$VCEL has breached the 200MA early in July, and held all other moving averages (20, 50, and 100) since then. The momentum continues to the upside, and the trend is strongly upwards. This is, without a doubt, a buy, with a stop loss placed just below the 20MA. While we aren&rsquo;t long this stock, we do have a bullish bias here. As always, should you get long, size your position according to your personal risk tolerance.</p>

    <link href="http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/27/lite-200ma-bounce/"/>
    <updated>2017-09-27T10:41:52-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/27/lite-200ma-bounce</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders,</p>

<p>As small caps continue to grind higher, we can look towards individual stocks to get long. One stock in the small caps in particular is $LITE. Please observe the chart below.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170927/lite_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170927/lite_daily.png" alt="LITE Daily - 2017-09-27" /></a></p>

<p>$LITE tagged the 200MA yesterday and bounced nicely off of it today. We&rsquo;re looking to jump in on the trend here at a good trade location, with a stop just below the 200MA, at 45.87. According to your personal risk tolerance, size your position accordingly.</p>

    <id>http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/27/eyes-on-jd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$JD has shown some decent strength over the past year. More recently, it has pulled back below the 100MA, and looks to be heading for the 200MA:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the chart of $IWM on the daily:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170927/jd_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170927/jd_daily.png" alt="JD Daily - 2017-09-27" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re looking for a deeper pullback to the 200MA before getting long this stock, with a stop below the 200MA when it happens.</p>

<p>For now, this is a sit-and-wait situation. We&rsquo;ll keep the stock on our watchlist.</p>
