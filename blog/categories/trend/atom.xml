    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$NFLX has recently dipped hard. The question on many people&rsquo;s minds is, where will things be headed for this stock, and how do we trade it?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the current chart of $NFLX on the daily timeframe:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170926/nflx_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170926/nflx_daily.png" alt="NFLX Daily - 2017-09-26" /></a></p>

<p>For the past year, prices have been trending well above the 200MA and 100MA. More importantly, pullbacks to the 100MA have been rare, and pullbacks to the 50MA have been more frequent. However, prices are currently trading right at the 50MA, a prime location to get long some shares.</p>

<p>Should one get long here with a conservative position size, the stop should be placed just below the 50MA with enough buffer accounting for the noise of the stock, at $169.44. For a more aggressive position size, a tighter stop can be placed at $173.78.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$AXON has been of high interest today, due to failed drug trial. Noise aside, let&rsquo;s take a look at the daily chart, and what it means for the stock going forward.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170926/axon_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170926/axon_daily.png" alt="AXON Daily - 2017-09-26" /></a></p>

<p>After a failed drug trial, the stock is trading significantly lower. At this point, people tend to ask, &ldquo;Should I buy at such a discounted price?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer to that question, at least the answer for trend traders, is absolutely not. Trend followers love to be long stocks that are above the 200MA, and short stocks that are below the 200MA. If anything, trend traders would be looking to short this stock. However, given how far away from the 200MA it is, and given how recent the news was, we will not be shorting this stock. For those that are currently long this stock, understand that there is huge overhead supply above us, and if the stock were to ever turn around, it will take a while for prices to recover, regardless of the current situation.</p>

    <id>http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/26/mu-earnings-drama</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$MU has been of high interest today, due to earnings. Noise aside, let&rsquo;s take a look at the daily chart, and what it means for the stock going forward.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170926/mu_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170926/mu_daily.png" alt="MU Daily - 2017-09-26" /></a></p>

<p>Clearly, the trend is rising. For trend followers, or for those who are currently holding shares of this stock, $MU is, without a doubt, a hold. More aggressive trend traders can place a stop loss below the 50MA, and more conservative trend traders can place a stop loss below the 200MA. As of the time of writing, we are long $MU.</p>

<p>Bias: Bullish (Daily)<br/>
Stop (Aggressive): $32.00<br/>
Stop (Conservative): $25.92</p>

    <link href="http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/26/why-nke-is-a-long-term-buy/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$NKE has been of high interest lately. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the daily chart.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170926/nke_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170926/nke_daily.png" alt="NKE Daily - 2017-09-26" /></a></p>

<p>Upon first glance at $NKE on the daily chart, one can notice that the stock has been meandering back and forth along the 200MA, with an unclear direction. But stepping back up a timeframe and taking a look at this stock on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170926/nke_weekly.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170926/nke_weekly.png" alt="NKE Weekly - 2017-09-26" /></a></p>

<p>One can see that, on the weekly, the chart is very close to the 200MA, and the weekly trend of this chart is clearly going up. If one is considering a longer-term play in $NKE, then buying some shares here and having a stop below the 200MA on the weekly would be a decent choice to take.</p>

<p>Bias: Bullish (Weekly)<br/>
Stop: $46.89</p>
