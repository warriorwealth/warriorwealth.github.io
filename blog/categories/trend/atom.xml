    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$JD has shown some decent strength over the past year. More recently, it has pulled back below the 100MA, and looks to be heading for the 200MA:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the chart of $IWM on the daily:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re looking for a deeper pullback to the 200MA before getting long this stock, with a stop below the 200MA when it happens.</p>

<p>For now, this is a sit-and-wait situation. We&rsquo;ll keep the stock on our watchlist.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$IWM has been the leader of the indices. Usually, when something like this happens, people wonder if this is a chart to short. Mean reversion has to happen at some point, and $IWM should correct and come back down, right?</p>

<p>As trend traders, the last thing we want to do to $IWM is to short it. It&rsquo;s fine if we don&rsquo;t get long new highs, but it&rsquo;s definitely not our job to pick the tops and predict price movement. Rather, it&rsquo;s simply our job to follow price - that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the chart of $IWM on the daily:</p>

<p>Today, we&rsquo;ve put in another new high. The market is clearly signaling that risk is on. For those that are hesitant to get long the $IWM, there are numerous stocks to choose from in the small cap sector. Pick one that&rsquo;s trending up, get in with an appropriate stop placement and position size, and ride the trend for as long as you can.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$VERI has been a runner over the past few weeks. The question now is, should we short it?</p>

<p>As trend traders, the last thing we want to do to $VERI is to short it. It&rsquo;s nice to paint tops and have our little egos stroked when this thing comes crashing down fast, but trend traders <em>follow</em> the price movement, not predict it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the chart on the daily:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170927/veri_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170927/veri_daily.png" alt="VERI Daily - 2017-09-27" /></a></p>

<p>Today, we have a massive red candle engulfing the prior three trading sessions. As far as we&rsquo;re concerned, the overall trend on the daily chart is going up. Ignoring everything else like news, PE ratios, or whatever fundamental analysis, this chart is a screaming long. As Paul Tudor Jones once said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&hellip;at the end of the day, your job is to buy what goes up and to sell what goes down so really who gives a damn about PE’s? If it’s going up you’re supposed to be long it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Put another way, your goal is to jump in on the trend, up or down, depending on your timeframe. How much risk you&rsquo;re willing to put on this trend trade depends on where you place your stop. Conservative trend traders would place a stop below the existing 50MA, and more aggressive trend traders would place it at a closer MA (20MA).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$NFLX has recently dipped hard. The question on many people&rsquo;s minds is, where will things be headed for this stock, and how do we trade it?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the current chart of $NFLX on the daily timeframe:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170926/nflx_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170926/nflx_daily.png" alt="NFLX Daily - 2017-09-26" /></a></p>

<p>For the past year, prices have been trending well above the 200MA and 100MA. More importantly, pullbacks to the 100MA have been rare, and pullbacks to the 50MA have been more frequent. However, prices are currently trading right at the 50MA, a prime location to get long some shares.</p>

<p>Should one get long here with a conservative position size, the stop should be placed just below the 50MA with enough buffer accounting for the noise of the stock, at $169.44. For a more aggressive position size, a tighter stop can be placed at $173.78.</p>

    <updated>2017-09-26T16:00:10-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/26/axon-axed</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$AXON has been of high interest today, due to failed drug trial. Noise aside, let&rsquo;s take a look at the daily chart, and what it means for the stock going forward.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170926/axon_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170926/axon_daily.png" alt="AXON Daily - 2017-09-26" /></a></p>

<p>After a failed drug trial, the stock is trading significantly lower. At this point, people tend to ask, &ldquo;Should I buy at such a discounted price?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer to that question, at least the answer for trend traders, is absolutely not. Trend followers love to be long stocks that are above the 200MA, and short stocks that are below the 200MA. If anything, trend traders would be looking to short this stock. However, given how far away from the 200MA it is, and given how recent the news was, we will not be shorting this stock. For those that are currently long this stock, understand that there is huge overhead supply above us, and if the stock were to ever turn around, it will take a while for prices to recover, regardless of the current situation.</p>
