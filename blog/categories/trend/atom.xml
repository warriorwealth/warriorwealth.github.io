    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the entire world participates in the bull market, one can look towards specific stocks, particularly Chinese stocks, to get long.</p>

<p>One particular stock that showed up on our radar is $BZUN. Please observe the chart below.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170930/bzun_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170930/bzun_daily.png" alt="BZUN Daily - 2017-09-30" /></a></p>

<p>Like many other stocks, $BZUN has come back down to tag the 50MA. As trend traders, we love when opportunities such as this one present themselves. This is a great place to get long some shares to participate in the trend.</p>

<p>Stop can be placed just below the 50MA, at around $28.16.</p>

<p>More conservative traders can enter in with half position size at current prices, and another half down at the 100MA (27.78), with the stop below the 100MA, at around $23.20.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: our investment team is currently long $BZUN.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As small caps make new highs, one can look towards individual stocks in the Russell 2000 to get long.</p>

<p>One of these is $WTW. Please observe the daily chart below.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170930/wtw_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170930/wtw_daily.png" alt="WTW Daily - 2017-09-30" /></a></p>

<p>$WTW has come back down to tag the 50MA. This is actually quite a great location to join the trend. You know right away whether or not you&rsquo;ll be right. Consider placing the stop loss just below the 50MA, at about $40.36. More aggressive traders can size up bigger and use a tighter stop loss at $41.77.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While the biotech sector picks up momentum, one can look for opportunities in specific stocks to get long.</p>

<p>One prime example of this is $ILMN. Please observe the chart below.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170928/ilmn_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170928/ilmn_daily.png" alt="ILMN Daily - 2017-09-28" /></a></p>

<p>$ILMN has come back down to tag the 50MA. One can consider getting long half a piece here, first. Should the stock come down lower to tag the 100MA, the other half can be placed.</p>

<p>Stop loss should be placed just below the 100MA, at around $178.51. This allows for some buffer room below the major moving average to account for potential noise.</p>

<p>More aggressive traders can simply go in with full size, with a stop below the 50MA, around $188.18.</p>

    <link href="http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/28/a-look-at-bbry/"/>
    <updated>2017-09-28T22:15:54-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/28/a-look-at-bbry</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$BBRY has picked up a lot of chatter recently, so let&rsquo;s take a look at the chart of the stock on the daily timeframe.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170928/bbry_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170928/bbry_daily.png" alt="BBRY Daily - 2017-09-28" /></a></p>

<p>Towards the beginning of the year, $BBRY managed to pierce above the 200MA and trend upwards. In August, prices came back down to tag the 200MA before bouncing higher. While we did not get long this stock at that time, the stock is still a decent candidate to get long right now, with a stop just below the 200MA.</p>

<p>More aggressive traders can place the stop below the 100MA - this allows them to go in with a larger position size, albeit a higher possibility of their getting stopped out should prices come back down.</p>

<p>Should one get long here with a conservative position size, using the 200MA as a reference, the stop would be placed at $8.01.</p>

    <link href="http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/28/blue-breakout-to-fresh-highs/"/>
    <updated>2017-09-28T07:25:15-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/28/blue-breakout-to-fresh-highs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello traders,</p>

<p>As $BLUE breaks out to new highs, one may consider if it&rsquo;s too late to go long. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the daily chart of $BLUE below.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170928/blue_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170928/blue_daily.png" alt="BLUE Daily - 2017-09-28" /></a></p>

<p>$BLUE has consistently held the 200MA and 100MA since last year, and we&rsquo;re now seeing the stock trend above the 20MA. This is a signal of a strong upwards trend. While that can change at any moment, current signals point to getting long.</p>

<p>For trend traders, what matters isn&rsquo;t about how much money to make. <strong>Rather, what matters is being in the trend with the right position size, according to your personal risk tolerance, in order to stay in the trend.</strong></p>

<p>Conservative traders would use the 200MA as a reference point when considering where to place their stop as part of the trend trade, while more aggressive traders would use the 20MA, as placing a closer stop allows them to have a bigger position size (albeit getting stopped out earlier should the stock fall down, but maintain trend above the 200MA). Again, this choice is up to the investor, and is one we highly recommend each individual consider before taking on a position in order to be able to hold for the duration of the trend.</p>

<p>Always consider the amount of risk you&rsquo;re willing to take in the position, before you think about potential profits. As long as you manage risk properly, you&rsquo;ll be able to stay with the trend.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: we are currently long $BLUE, with a stop below the 200MA at $85.51 as of the time of writing.</p>
