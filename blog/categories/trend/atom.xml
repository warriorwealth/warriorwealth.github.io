    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The market continues to make new highs. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the trend for all of the major market indices, starting with the $SPY.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170930/spy_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170930/spy_daily.png" alt="SPY Daily - 2017-09-30" /></a></p>

<p>$SPY has continued to soar higher, maintaining its position well above all major moving averages. The trend here is clearly up.</p>

<p>The same story is true for the Dow Jones:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170930/dia_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170930/dia_daily.png" alt="DIA Daily - 2017-09-30" /></a></p>

<p>Here is the Nasdaq:</p>

<p>One can consider joining in on the trend here via $QLD - it&rsquo;s cheaper.</p>

<p>Finally, we have the star of the show - $IWM:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170930/iwm_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170930/iwm_daily.png" alt="IWM Daily - 2017-09-30" /></a></p>

<p>$IWM has a huge breakout and continues to climb higher. One can certainly go long this ETF, or can consider getting long specific small cap stocks, <a href="/blog/2017/09/30/watching-weight-watchers-wtw/" title="Long $WTW">such as $WTW</a>.</p>

<p>Taking a look outside of the US and at China, here&rsquo;s $FXI, an ETF tracking the Chinese Market</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170930/fxi_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170930/fxi_daily.png" alt="FXI Daily - 2017-09-30" /></a></p>

<p>Trend holds as we bounce off of the 50MA. The overall trend here is bullish as well. One can look towards specific stocks in China to get long, <a href="/blog/2017/09/30/exposure-to-china/" title="Long $BZUN">such as $BZUN</a>.</p>

<h3>Recap</h3>

<p><strong>Trend of Market: UP</strong><br/>
<strong>Our Bias: Bullish</strong><br/></p>

<p>Our investment team will continue to maintain our bullish stance on the market until circumstances change. For now, we hold all positions in our portfolio, and will continue to do so until we get a sell signal.</p>

<p>Have a great weekend!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the entire world participates in the bull market, one can look towards specific stocks, particularly Chinese stocks, to get long.</p>

<p>One particular stock that showed up on our radar is $BZUN. Please observe the chart below.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170930/bzun_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170930/bzun_daily.png" alt="BZUN Daily - 2017-09-30" /></a></p>

<p>Like many other stocks, $BZUN has come back down to tag the 50MA. As trend traders, we love when opportunities such as this one present themselves. This is a great place to get long some shares to participate in the trend.</p>

<p>Stop can be placed just below the 50MA, at around $28.16.</p>

<p>More conservative traders can enter in with half position size at current prices, and another half down at the 100MA (27.78), with the stop below the 100MA, at around $23.20.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: our investment team is currently long $BZUN.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As small caps make new highs, one can look towards individual stocks in the Russell 2000 to get long.</p>

<p>One of these is $WTW. Please observe the daily chart below.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170930/wtw_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170930/wtw_daily.png" alt="WTW Daily - 2017-09-30" /></a></p>

<p>$WTW has come back down to tag the 50MA. This is actually quite a great location to join the trend. You know right away whether or not you&rsquo;ll be right. Consider placing the stop loss just below the 50MA, at about $40.36. More aggressive traders can size up bigger and use a tighter stop loss at $41.77.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While the biotech sector picks up momentum, one can look for opportunities in specific stocks to get long.</p>

<p>One prime example of this is $ILMN. Please observe the chart below.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170928/ilmn_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170928/ilmn_daily.png" alt="ILMN Daily - 2017-09-28" /></a></p>

<p>$ILMN has come back down to tag the 50MA. One can consider getting long half a piece here, first. Should the stock come down lower to tag the 100MA, the other half can be placed.</p>

<p>Stop loss should be placed just below the 100MA, at around $178.51. This allows for some buffer room below the major moving average to account for potential noise.</p>

<p>More aggressive traders can simply go in with full size, with a stop below the 50MA, around $188.18.</p>

    <link href="http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/28/a-look-at-bbry/"/>
    <updated>2017-09-28T22:15:54-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://warriorwealth.github.io/blog/2017/09/28/a-look-at-bbry</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>$BBRY has picked up a lot of chatter recently, so let&rsquo;s take a look at the chart of the stock on the daily timeframe.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170928/bbry_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170928/bbry_daily.png" alt="BBRY Daily - 2017-09-28" /></a></p>

<p>Towards the beginning of the year, $BBRY managed to pierce above the 200MA and trend upwards. In August, prices came back down to tag the 200MA before bouncing higher. While we did not get long this stock at that time, the stock is still a decent candidate to get long right now, with a stop just below the 200MA.</p>

<p>More aggressive traders can place the stop below the 100MA - this allows them to go in with a larger position size, albeit a higher possibility of their getting stopped out should prices come back down.</p>

<p>Should one get long here with a conservative position size, using the 200MA as a reference, the stop would be placed at $8.01.</p>
