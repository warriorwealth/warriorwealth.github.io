Hey warriors,

I got a couple of trade ideas for you this coming week.

We'll start with <span class="ticker">$VRX</span>:

[![VRX - 2017-06-25](/images/blog/20170625/vrx.png)](/images/blog/20170625/vrx.png)

I'm interested in getting long if we get a close above the 200 day moving average denoted by the peach-colored line.

Another one on my radar is <span class="ticker">$STLD</span>:

We have ourselves a pullback to the 200 day moving average. This presents a great trade location, so I'm interested in buying some here.

Starting tomorrow, I'll be placing trades in a separate account that I've created for the purposes of this blog. Feel free to follow along with my portfolio and enter/exit trades with me.
