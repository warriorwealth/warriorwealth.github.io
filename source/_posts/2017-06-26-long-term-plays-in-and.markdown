Hey warriors,

I was scouring the charts today and found a couple of tickers that present great buys at their current locations.

<span class="ticker">$GS</span>:

[![GS - 2017-06-26](/images/blog/20170626/gs.png)](/images/blog/20170626/gs.png)

I'm interested in getting long here, and getting out if price closes below 209.22.

<span class="ticker">$DIS</span>:

Another candidate falling in great trade location. I'm interested in getting long, with a stop loss at 102, meaning if price falls below 102, I'm getting out of my shares.

My goal is to keep losers small and ride winners for as long as they are working. This allows me to cut the losers while maximizing the profits from multi-baggers, resulting in a positive expectancy trading system. Cheers!
