Hey warriors,

So market dips a bit today, especially the Nasdaq. If this continues throughout the rest of the broad market indices, one can look for short opportunities that present great trade locations.

I was looking around and found a nicely downward trending stock that you've probably heard of:

<span class="ticker">$GILD</span>:

I'm interested in getting short here, and getting out if we cross over 73.96. Again, not a bad place to get short as we have a retracement to the 200MA, and it is with the trend. Remember, we don't really care about the news. Price is what makes us money!

This stock will be on my radar for tomorrow. Cheers!
