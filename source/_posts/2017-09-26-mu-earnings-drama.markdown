Clearly, the trend is rising. For trend followers, or for those who are currently holding shares of this stock, $MU is, without a doubt, a hold. More aggressive trend traders can place a stop loss below the 50MA, and more conservative trend traders can place a stop loss below the 200MA. As of the time of writing, we are long $MU.
