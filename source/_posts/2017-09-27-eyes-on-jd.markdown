$JD has shown some decent strength over the past year. More recently, it has pulled back below the 100MA, and looks to be heading for the 200MA:

Here's the chart of $IWM on the daily:

We're looking for a deeper pullback to the 200MA before getting long this stock, with a stop below the 200MA when it happens.

For now, this is a sit-and-wait situation. We'll keep the stock on our watchlist.
