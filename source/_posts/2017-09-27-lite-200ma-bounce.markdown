Hey traders,

As small caps continue to grind higher, we can look towards individual stocks to get long. One stock in the small caps in particular is $LITE. Please observe the chart below.

[![LITE Daily - 2017-09-27](/images/blog/20170927/lite_daily.png)](/images/blog/20170927/lite_daily.png)

$LITE tagged the 200MA yesterday and bounced nicely off of it today. We're looking to jump in on the trend here at a good trade location, with a stop just below the 200MA, at 45.87. According to your personal risk tolerance, size your position accordingly.
