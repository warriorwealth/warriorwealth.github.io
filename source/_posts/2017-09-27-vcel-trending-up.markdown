Hey traders,

One hot stock today is $VCEL. Let's take a look at the chart.

$VCEL has breached the 200MA early in July, and held all other moving averages (20, 50, and 100) since then. The momentum continues to the upside, and the trend is strongly upwards. This is, without a doubt, a buy, with a stop loss placed just below the 20MA. While we aren't long this stock, we do have a bullish bias here. As always, should you get long, size your position according to your personal risk tolerance.
