Like many other stocks, $BZUN has come back down to tag the 50MA. As trend traders, we love when opportunities such as this one present themselves. This is a great place to get long some shares to participate in the trend.

Stop can be placed just below the 50MA, at around $28.16.

More conservative traders can enter in with half position size at current prices, and another half down at the 100MA (27.78), with the stop below the 100MA, at around $23.20.

*Disclaimer: our investment team is currently long $BZUN.*
