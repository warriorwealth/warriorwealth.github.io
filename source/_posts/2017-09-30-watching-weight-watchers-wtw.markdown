As small caps make new highs, one can look towards individual stocks in the Russell 2000 to get long.

One of these is $WTW. Please observe the daily chart below.

$WTW has come back down to tag the 50MA. This is actually quite a great location to join the trend. You know right away whether or not you'll be right. Consider placing the stop loss just below the 50MA, at about $40.36. More aggressive traders can size up bigger and use a tighter stop loss at $41.77.

*Disclaimer: our investment team is currently long $WTW.*
