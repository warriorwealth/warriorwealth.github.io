The semiconductor sector $SMH has trended like a beast for over a year now, and in all time frames, the trend continues.

Let's take a look at the daily chart of $SMH below:

Any pullback here is a buy in our books. Consider getting long individual stocks in this sector, such as $AMAT or $MU.

*Disclaimer: [our investment team is currently long $MU as of time of writing](/portfolio/ "Portfolio").*
